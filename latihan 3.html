        Seventeen is a renowned South Korean boy band that was formed by Pledis Entertainment, captivating fans worldwide with their dynamic performances and impressive versatility. This 13-member ensemble is meticulously organized into three distinct sub-units based on their expertise: the Hip-Hop Unit, the Vocal Unit, and the Performance Unit. Each sub-unit showcases the members' specialized skills, contributing to the group's multifaceted approach to music and performance. The name "Seventeen" is a clever amalgamation of their total number of members, the three sub-units, and the number one, symbolizing their unity as a cohesive team. This unique naming reflects their philosophy and commitment to collective creativity and collaboration. Known as a "self-producing idol" group, Seventeen is distinguished by their active involvement in every aspect of their music career, from composing and producing their own songs to choreographing intricate dance routines. Their self-reliance and artistry were first showcased with their debut track "Adore U" in 2015, marking the beginning of a successful journey that has seen them gain international acclaim and a dedicated fan base.
